PointPillars for 3D Point Cloud Processing
This repository contains an implementation of a PointPillars model integrated with Intel RealSense cameras for processing point clouds and performing 3D object detection.

Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to capture real-time 3D data from Intel RealSense cameras, preprocess it into a Birdâ€™s Eye View (BEV) representation, and run it through a neural network model for object detection or classification.

Key components include:

PointPillars Neural Network Model: A custom PyTorch-based model for processing BEV data.
Intel RealSense Integration: Captures depth and RGB data, which is converted into a 3D point cloud.
Real-Time Inference: Performs object detection in real-time on processed data.
Features
Real-time depth and color data capture using Intel RealSense.
3D point cloud generation and filtering using Open3D.
Bird's Eye View (BEV) projection of point cloud data.
A simple neural network model for classification and detection tasks.
File Description
pointpillar_5.py: Main Python script containing the following:
PointPillars model definition.
Integration with Intel RealSense cameras.
Real-time preprocessing of 3D point clouds into BEV.
Real-time inference with a PyTorch model.
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.8+
Intel RealSense SDK
PyTorch
Open3D
NumPy
Other libraries: torch.optim, torch.nn

Clone the repository:




git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pointpillars-project.git
cd pointpillars-project
Install dependencies:

pip install numpy open3d torch pyrealsense2
Ensure Intel RealSense SDK is installed:

Refer to Intel RealSense Installation Guide.
Usage
Connect an Intel RealSense camera to your computer.

The system will:

Capture depth and color frames from the RealSense camera.
Preprocess the frames into a point cloud and convert it into BEV.
Run real-time inference using the PointPillars model.
Stop the script using Ctrl+C when finished.

Model Architecture
The custom PointPillars model consists of:

Encoder: Three convolutional layers for feature extraction.
Classifier: A linear layer for final object classification.
Example Output
Detected objects will be printed in the terminal during runtime.
